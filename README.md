This is a simple web-based Expense Tracker app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add expenses by entering a name, amount, and date, which are displayed in a table with a running total. Each expense can be deleted individually, updating the total dynamically. The app validates inputs to ensure data accuracy and resets on page reload (no data persistence). It's ideal for basic personal budgeting and demonstrates DOM manipulation and event handling in vanilla JS.
